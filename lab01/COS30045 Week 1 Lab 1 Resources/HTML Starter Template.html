	<h1>Pets and the Pandemic</h1>
	<h2><a href="https://github.com/benzo-tea/COS30045">Benzo-Tea</a></h2>
	<p> Pet ownership has increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. This can be attributed to
		the human need for companionship and social interaction across many different beings. At the beginning
		of the pandemic, couples and families have been looking for mainly cats & dogs to accompany them
		in their time of home isolation. This is probably because we are all feeling a bit <strong>lonely</strong>.</p>

		A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their 
		household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a significant increase in the percent of households 
		taking in a new dog, fish or bird. Their research also indicated that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such as:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Decreased stress levels</li>
			<li>Improved heart health</li>
			<li>Assist children with emotional and social support</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers to consider the needs of 
			companion animals and their owners when considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are 
			well as accepting animals in public places and transport.
